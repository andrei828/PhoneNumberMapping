## High level overview
A user will make a phone call to number X to request a Tiwlio phone number. After this, for any phone calls made to the Twilio number, the user will receive an SMS. This tool is helpful if you want to get contacted but don't want do disclose your phone number. The reservation lasts two hours and if the user wants an extension, he makes another phone call to numbe X.

## Serverless with Firebase functions
There are multiple entry points.

A more in depth documentation of the project is comming soon...
